	<div id="wrapper"><p class="text">Shiva as we know him today shares many features with the Vedic god Rudra,[97] and both Shiva and Rudra are viewed as the same personality in Hindu scriptures. The two names are used synonymously. Rudra, a Rigvedic deity with fearsome powers, was the god of the roaring storm. He is usually portrayed in accordance with the element he represents as a fierce, destructive deity.[98] In RV 2.33, he is described as the "Father of the Rudras", a group of storm gods.[99]

Flood notes that Rudra is an ambiguous god, peripheral in the Vedic pantheon, possibly indicating non-Vedic origins.[16] Nevertheless, both Rudra and Shiva are akin to Wodan, the Germanic God of rage ("w√ºtte") and the wild hunt.[100][101][102]

According to Sadasivan, during the development of the Hindu synthesis attributes of the Buddha were transfered by Brahmins to Shiva, who was also linked with Rudra.[14] The Rigveda has 3 out of 1,028 hymns dedicated to Rudra, and he finds occasional mention in other hymns of the same text.[103] Hymn 10.92 of the Rigveda states that deity Rudra has two natures, one wild and cruel (Rudra), another that is kind and tranquil (Shiva).</p></div>
